## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** I had a lot of fun doing the character designs, backgrounds and spritesheets and it looks very good together.
- **Creating the Code:** Thanks to the teachers and tutors I was able to understand and create the overall code for my game. 

### Challenges:
- **Spritesheets:** I had a lot of problems regarding the spritesheets for both the player and the enemy. 
- **Return to Homescreen Button:** Originally, the game had a return to homescreen button which I scratched because of many difficulties.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Asking for help:** Asking for help is never wrong and very useful in most cases. 
- **Keep it Simple:** Creating a simple game in such a short time was a good choice.
